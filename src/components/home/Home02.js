                <p>The Composition is one of ten large paintings which Miró produced in Barcelona in 1933.</p>
                <p>They were preceded by ten collages of newspaper illustrations and advertisements.</p>
                <p>In the new paintings, the painter subsequently clarified for himself the mutual </p>
                <p>relationships of painting elements regarding their shapes, colours, and incorporation</p>
                <p>in space. The Composition which comes from this series and which is in the collection</p>
                <p> of the National Gallery in Prague accomplishes this painter’s endeavour.</p>
